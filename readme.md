# HTML Linting with htmlhint

## HTML deserves to be as well maintained as your other code.

### Play with this simple html linting setup with the following steps.

- clone this repo to your desktop.
- run "npm install"
- test the linting by running "npm run lint:html" (this script is short for "htmlhint \"./**/*.html\"", and is defined in the package.json)

You should see two errors pop up (one for src-not-empty, and the other for tag-pair).
If not, make sure you ran "npm install".

Enjoy!
